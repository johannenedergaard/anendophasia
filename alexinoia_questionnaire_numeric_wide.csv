I think I do this more when I watch youtube because it can feel like the person is talking directly to me. I think I talk back more when I (allegedly) smoke weed. I think I talk out loud more in general when I allegedly have thc in my system. I love being around people but I rarely feel lonely even though I'm seeing people a lot less now that I live alone. I wonder if the way I have conversations with myself is part of the reason I don't get lonely? I really enjoy my own company and find myself quite funny. When I am sad/anxious/lonely I like to imagine myself holding me (sometimes kid me) and kissing my own forehead and telling myself it will all be okay. It works really well for me.
