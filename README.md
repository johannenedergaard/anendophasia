# Alexinoia
## Inner speech and cognition

The `alexinoia_raw` folder contains two raw csv files from each participant, one with browser interaction data and one with experiment data. Participants were recruited to participate in four behavioural experiments: rhyme judgments from images, task switching with simple arithmetic problems, reproduction memory for a string of words, and same/different judgments of pictures of cats and dogs.
