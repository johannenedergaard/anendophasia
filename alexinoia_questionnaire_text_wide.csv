I live alone for the first time in my life and I've noticed talk to myself in my head quite a bit. I enjoy talking out loud to myself sometimes. If someone really funny or crazy happens when I'm watching something I respond outloud occasionally. I think I do this more when I watch youtube because it can feel like the person is talking directly to me. I think I talk back more when I (allegedly) smoke weed. I think I talk out loud more in general when I allegedly have thc in my system. I love being around people but I rarely feel lonely even though I'm seeing people a lot less now that I live alone. I wonder if the way I have conversations with myself is part of the reason I don't get lonely? I really enjoy my own company and find myself quite funny. When I am sad/anxious/lonely I like to imagine myself holding me (sometimes kid me) and kissing my own forehead and telling myself it will all be okay. It works really well for me. Also, growing up my parents weren't super strict and I've always been my harshest critic so I wonder if that's why I never hear their voices saying stuff to me?","sona","UymiJiZrTrjLlVeTOvDd",13,19,5,12,3,8,21,11,14,18,2,15,16,7,10,9,17,20,1,4,22,6,4.58333333333333,3.8,"high_verbal"
