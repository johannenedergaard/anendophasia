	abstract = {This chapter aims to clear a path for the thesis that inner speech, in the very languages we speak, is the sole medium of all conceptual thought. First, it is argued that inner speech should not be identified with the auditory imagery of speech. Since they are distinct, there may be many more episodes of inner speech than those that are accompanied by auditory imagery. Second, it is argued that it is not necessary to conceive of linguistic communication as a matter of the speaker’s revealing through words an underlying thought. Rather, acts of speech may be conceived as producing cooperation by intervening on processes of thought that are essentially imagistic. So conceived, the practice of speaking in language may acquire a function wholly internal to the individual, where it adds a layer of coordination to an underlying foundation of imagistic cognition.},

              about
              thoughts when they are linguistically formulated. Section 7.1 makes the general argument that intentional ascent (thinking about thinking) requires semantic ascent (thinking about language). Section 7.2 addresses Martínez-Manrique \& Vicente’s objection that the need to disambiguate indeterminacy in inner speech makes inner speech redundant as a potential vehicle for consciously thinking about thoughts. Section 7.3 takes issue with Langland-Hassan’s proposal that episodes of inner speech cannot carry the right kind of content to serve as vehicles for intentional ascent. The final section rebuts the objection that conscious inner speech presupposes the ability to bring a thought to consciousness, and so this latter ability is the true
