It's not an easy study and I do not believe that you value your participants time by paying the rate that you have for a study that is this involved. Most of these types of cognitive studies pay a lot more. There are a lot of cognitive tests and a lot of blocks in those tests, at one point I thought that the study was broken and that the test wasn't going to end. Thank you for asking if I had any comments about the study, I appreciate being able to speak my mind about the study after I finished.","Please enter any comments, concerns, or suggestions.","comments",1.08,2.4,"low_verbal"
